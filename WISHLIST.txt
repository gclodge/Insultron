This document is intended to serve as a standing 'wishlist' for features to be added.

- (yall) Add automated tracking of movie recommendations (and serialize to disk every N minutes - would track last time written, override on error to serialize first)
	..	Add movies to map, count numbers of times recommended, number of times watched, last time watched
		- [DONE @ 2250 2021.02.09] Requires !recommend command to do the Enmap.Ensure (which checks if the key exists, if not it adds a default entry)
		- Requires !watch|watched <movie ID> to iterate watch count, assign last time watched
		- First recommend adds to map, successive iterate recommend count
	.. Want to be able to remove from list (!remove), and view current list (!list) as well.

- (GC) Add argument to '!insult' so users can request certain words be used in the insult if possible
	.. Thinking like !insult @user <word1> .. <wordN> with a cap at N=3 for now

- (GC) Add function to get each insult component which tracks what the last word used in that place was.
	.. Want to prevent repetition of a single component in back-to-back insults
	.. Would need to track (in-memory) what the last word was for each component then loop until we get a different one
	.. Can store the last used words of each component in the 'Client' object along with words

- (GC) Add '!gif' search function which uses the built-in /giphy command
	.. Hoping to simply get and return a single gif from any text supplied by user and rolling that damn dice
	.. Maybe include a 'rating' value if you can

- (GC) Add some automated usage of '/tableflip' '/unflip' and '/shrug'
